There was some stuff other stuff in Northern Europe but after that the Phoney war was over.</P>
<h2>German Invasion</h2>
<p>During the Phoney war the Allies took to long to make a move and that allowed Hitler to have his army ready for the 
Invasion.</p>
<p>During the Inter war periods France put together a series of forts along the Franco-Prussian border called
'The Maginot Line' that was thought to be impenetrable but Germany had a better idea.
