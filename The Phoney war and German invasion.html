<h1>The Phoney War</h1>
<p>After the Germans invaded Poland France and the UK declared war but didn't dare invade for fear of a repeat of
the First World War.This was called 'The Phoney War' where no-one dared move</p>


<p>But the French decided to make the first move called 'The Saar Offensive' but gave up after a few days. After this
There was some stuff other stuff in Northern Europe but after that the Phoney war was over.</P>
<h2>German Invasion</h2>
<p>During the Phoney war the Allies took to long to make a move and that allowed Hitler to have his army ready for the 
Invasion.</p>
<p>During the Inter war periods France put together a series of forts along the Franco-Prussian border called
'The Maginot Line' that was thought to be impenetrable but Germany had a better idea.</p>

<p>The Germans punched through Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg coping what they did years earlier with 'The Schlieffen Plan'
