<h1>Why DID France surrender in WWII</h1>


<body>
France Surrendered in the Second World war because the German blitzkrieg through Belgium actually worked and France's top Soldiers had been encircled with the British at Dunkirk
 leaving only the Untrained reserves to fend off the German war Machine.

 <p>
 Another Reason that France surrendered is because they didn't want their landmarks being destroyed like Poland 
 where Germany bombed Warsaw into oblivion and all that was left of the Main city was husks of buildings without windows
